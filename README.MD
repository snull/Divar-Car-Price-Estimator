# Divar Car Price Estimator

This is a Python program for estimating car price based on Divar.ir data.

## Installing requirements

Use the package manager [pip] to install requirements.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run main.py using a terminal.

(The program is TUI-based, and it's better if your terminal supports UTF-8.)


```bash
python3 main.py
```
(there is also a sample data to use named sample_data.sql in the folder.)
